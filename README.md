👋 **Hey Tech Enthusiasts! I’m** [**Shidan V**](https://shidan.magmc.in/)

This is a small contribution from my side for those who are passionate about **self-learning** and exploring the world of programming.

📘 Here, you’ll find introductory resources on **two programming languages**:

* **C Programming**
* **Java Programming**, along with **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts**

These materials are designed to help you understand the **basics and core technical foundations** of programming, making it easier to progress into more advanced concepts with confidence.

Happy learning! 🚀
