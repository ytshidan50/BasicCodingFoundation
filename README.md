👋 **Hey Tech Enthusiasts! I’m** [**Shidan V**](https://shidan.magmc.in/)

This is a small contribution from my side for those who are passionate about **self-learning** and exploring the world of programming.

📘 Here, you’ll find introductory resources on **two programming languages**:

* **C Programming**
